# Game Library Tracker

## 1. Description
Game Library Tracker is a lightweight MVC web app for gamers to catalog their PC/console/mobile titles and record play sessions. Each user can:

- **Build** a personal library of games (title, platform).  
- **Log** each play session with date, duration, and quick notes.  
- **Review** their play history per game to see when and how long they’ve played.  

This app solves the “lost‑track” problem: gamers often forget which games they own, how far they got, or what strategies they tried. By centralizing your game list and session notes, you get clear visibility into your play habits and progress.
